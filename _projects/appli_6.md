* Epigenetic influence plays a role in the association between exposure to air pollution and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
* we investigate the associations between prenatal SO2 exposure and ADHD rating scale (ARS) at ages 4, 6 and 8 years repeatedly in a mother–child cohort (n = 329). 
* Whole blood samples were obtained at ages 2 and 6 years, and genome‐wide DNA methylation (DNAm) was analyzed for 51 children using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation BeadChip. 
* We analyzed the associations between prenatal SO2 exposure and DNAm levels at ages 2 and 6, and further investigated the association between the DNAm and ARS at ages 4, 6 and 8. 
* Prenatal SO2 exposure was associated with ADHD symptoms. 
* From candidate gene analysis, DNAm levels at the 6 CpGs at age 2 were associated with prenatal SO2 exposure levels. 
* Of the 6 CpGs, cg07583420 (INS-IGF2) was persistently linked with ARS at ages 4, 6 and 8. Epigenome‐wide analysis showed that DNAm at 6733 CpG sites were associated with prenatal SO2 exposure, of which 58 CpGs involved in Notch signalling pathway were further associated with ARS at age 4, 6 and 8 years, persistently. 
* DNAm at age 6 was not associated with prenatal SO2 exposure. Changes in DNAm levels associated with prenatal SO2 exposure during early childhood are associated with increases in ARS in later childhood.
