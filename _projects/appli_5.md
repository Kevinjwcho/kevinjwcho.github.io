## Predict Demand and Supply of medical services

_This project was done by medical college, Seoul National University, Especially Dr. Hong. All rights reserved._

* To be prepared for the next 60 years, we need to predict demand and supply of the medical services by various scinarios.
* The scinarios are divided by the birth rate simulation done by Korean govornmnet, (Statistics Korea)[http://kostat.go.kr/portal/eng/index.action]
* I used the past medical demand per capita with different age to predict the demand.
* Also I predict the supply of medical services by predicting the number of admitted medical students annually.
* Instead of using machine learning of AI, I used basic statistical method, since the data is accumulated by annually for few years.
