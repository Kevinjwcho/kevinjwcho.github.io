*I am actively seeking for data science internship position in 2024 Summer.*

I am currently a `Ph.D.` student in the Department of Statistics at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.stat.pitt.edu), engaged in research under the guidance of Dr. Kehui Chen since 2020. Before commencing my doctoral studies, I served as an `Associate` in research at the [Medical College of Seoul National University](https://medicine.snu.ac.kr/), where I collaborated with Dr. Yun-chul Hong. My research during this period encompassed the analysis of gene expression, methylation patterns, microbiome compositions, and time series  biomarker data.

My research is primarily focused on `Dynamic Prediction in Survival Analysis` and `Network Data Analysis.` These areas are critical to statistical research, providing significant advancements in predictive modeling and the understanding of complex data relationships. My aim is to integrate theoretical foundations with practical applications, particularly in the context of data science.
